### Phase 2: Application Development
**AI Tool Used:** Bolt AI  
**Date:** 26/05/2025  
**Purpose:** Build the actual loyalty rewards application

#### Development Prompt Given to Bolt AI:

Create a Local Business Loyalty Rewards App using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Build a simple loyalty rewards web app for local salons, barbershops, and eateries. The app should have these features:

**Core Functionality:**
- Customer registration using phone number and name
- Business owner can log customer visits by entering their phone number
- Point system: customers earn 1 point per visit
- Reward system: customers get a free service/item after 10 visits
- Display customer's current points and visits until next reward

**Pages/Sections:**
1. Customer View: Enter phone number to check points and rewards status
2. Business Owner View: Add visits for customers by phone number
3. Simple dashboard showing recent activity

**Requirements:**
- Store all data in browser memory (no database needed)
- Clean, mobile-friendly design
- Use different colored cards/sections for customers vs business owner
- Include a few sample customers with existing points for demo purposes
- Add simple animations for when points are earned or rewards are achieved

Sample businesses to include: "Tony's Barber Shop", "Bella's Hair Salon", "Corner Cafe"

Make it visually appealing with a modern design, and ensure it works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

#### Bolt AI Output:
Based on your requirements, I'll create a beautifully designed Local Business Loyalty Rewards App with essential functionality for small businesses like salons, barbershops, and cafes. This first version will focus on delivering a clean, user-friendly interface with all the core features needed.

**Core Features:**

- Responsive design optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop experiences
- Clean typography with clear hierarchy using system fonts for optimal performance
- 8px spacing system with consistent padding and margins throughout
- Iconography from Lucide React for visual clarity and modern aesthetics
